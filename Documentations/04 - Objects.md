### Objects

> It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having to know details of each otherâ€™s data or code, it is sufficient to know the type of message accepted and type of response returned by the objects.

For example *Dog* is a real-life object, which has some characteristics like color, breed, bark, sleep, and eats.
