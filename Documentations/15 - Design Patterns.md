## Design Patterns

### What's a design pattern?

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

There are 23 design patterns that are grouped into 3 categories:

1. **Creational**: Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. Includes:

   - Abstract Factory
   - Builder
   - Factory Method
   - Prototype
   - Singleton

2. **Structural**: Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. Includes:

   - Adapter
   - Bridge
   - Composite
   - Decorator
   - Facade
   - Flyweight
   - Proxy

3. **Behavioral**: Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Includes:

   - Chain of Responsibility
   - Command
   - Interpreter
   - Iterator
   - Mediator
   - Memento
   - Observer
   - State
   - Strategy
   - Template Method
   - Visitor

**Tip**: The order of design patterns isn't important. So, you can choose which one to learn, regardless of the category.
