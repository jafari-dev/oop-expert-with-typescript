In creating this repository, I aimed to provide original examples to facilitate learning about object-oriented programming (OOP) pillars, SOLID principles, and design patterns using TypeScript. While there may be similarities between examples found in this repository and those in other resources, it's essential to emphasize that all code and documentation within this repository are original creations.

The following list includes resources that have inspired and informed my understanding of OOP, SOLID principles, and design patterns:

1. Head First Design Patterns (by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson)
2. Dive Into Design Patterns (by Alexander Shvets)
3. [GeeksForGeeks Website](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
4. [WikiPedia Website](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
5. +5 years of experience in the software development industry

The resources for the images in the repository are:

1. [The S.O.L.I.D Principles in Pictures](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/the-s-o-l-i-d-principles-in-pictures-b34ce2f1e898)
2. [Refactoring.guru Website](https://refactoring.guru/)
3. Google!

> Please note that while the concepts discussed in these resources may overlap with the content of this repository, all examples and code within this repository have been independently developed by myself with the goal of providing real-world scenarios and applications.
